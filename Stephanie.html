<h3 style="color:blue; font-family: arial;">My Past</h3>
<p>My name is Stephanie Paige Irving and I am 18 years old. I grew up with my 3 siblings (2 sisters, one brother) in Bethesda, MD all my life. I went to PreSchool at Bradley Hills, Enlementary/Middle school at Saint Jane Francis de Chantal School, and high school at Georgetown Visitation Preparatory School. My favorite color has always been yellow. I love to knit blankets with my sister, go hiking, and go fishing with my dad. I have always taken my academics very seriously and have gotten good grades for my hard work. I have also always been very organized. When I was younger, I used to make my bed and put my stuffed animals in color, size, and ~happiest~ order. </p>

<h3 style="color:blue; font-family: arial;">Present Day</h3>
<p>I graduated Georgetown Visitation during THE EVIL YEAR OF 2020. I am now a college freshman at Montgomery College, Rockville. I moved in with my dad and completely redesigned my room which was a lot of fun. We are getting a BRAND NEW CHOCOLATE LAB PUPPY on December 26th, 2020!!! and I am SO excited. It is our (as in me and my siblings) Christmas gift, BUT none of my other siblings know about it so it will be a surprise for them which is single handedly the HARDEST secret to keep in.

<h3 style="color:blue; font-family: arial;">The Future</h3>
<p>For Christmas, I am going away with my dad and my siblings to Buxton, NC for a couple days and then to ~PICK UP THE PUPPY~. This spring semester I am taking 16 credits which will be a little difficult, but I can do it. This summer I will be taking up to 15 credits. I am doing all of this in hopes of being able to transfer into the University of Maryland, College Park Business School. Once I am at College Park, I want to enroll into the MBA program so that I can graduate with my undergrad degree as well as an MBA degree. From there, I hope to get a successful job and to get married and make a family.
