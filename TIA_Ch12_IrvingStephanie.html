<p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, and is used to format web pages. HTML consists of a set up markup tags that describe different elements of a document, such as headings, paragraphs, and hyperlinks. The tags generally come in pairs, and are placed at the beginning and end of the text they are describing. Start tags are denoted by <> and end tags are denoted by &lt;</>/&gt;. For example, the text between &lt;p&gt; and &lt;p/&gt; describes a paragraph.</p>

<h3 style="color:blue; font-family: arial;">Creating an HTML Document</h3>
<p>You can easily create simple web pages in Word by just saving a Word document as a web page. However, for full functionality and control, it√≠s best to use a simple text editor such as Notepad in Windows.  All HTML documents begin with a DOCTYPE declaration that defines the document type followed by <HTML> and <body> to indicate that this is a web document, and visible page content, respectively. Headings are denoted by levels, H1 is the highest level of heading, H2 is the next highest heading level, and so forth to H6.</p>
